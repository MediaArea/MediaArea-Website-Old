            <description><![CDATA[+ Matroska: support of MKVMerge statistics tags (duration frame count, stream size, bit rate) per track, thanks to ndjamena<br />
                + FLAC: Channel positions, thanks to ndjamena<br />
                + FLAC: difference between detected bit depth and stored bit depth<br />
                + MPEG-TS: if DTVCC transport stream is present and no DTVCC service descriptor, scan also in the middle of the file in order to detect more caption services<br />
                + Subtitle frame rate computing if frame count and duration are available (hidden by default)<br />
                + Subtitles in Matroska: count of elements<br />
                + Matroska, MXF and MP4/MOV: detection of truncated files<br />
                + DTS: difference between ES Matrix and ES Discrete<br />
                + DTS: display ES Matrix or ES Discrete even if HRA or MA is present<br />
                + DTS: difference between DTS-HRA with 96k option and pure DTS-96/24<br />
                + DTS: detection of DTS:X<br />
                + Samples per frame info<br />
                + AC-3: detection of Atmos inside TrueHD<br />
                + Video frame rate: showing precision of 1/1.001 frame rates (e.g. "23.976 (24000/1001) fps" and "23.976 (23976/1000) fps")<br />
                + MPEG-4/MOV: showing the complete list of compatible brands in the CodecID field<br />
                + MPEG-4/MOV: Alternate groups<br />
                + MPEG-4/MOV: "Disabled" tag<br />
                + MPEG-4/MOV: "Forced" tag<br />
                + MPEG-4/MOV: showing links between tracks (chapters for, subtitles for, fallback for)<br />
                + MXF: handling of more acquisition metadata items<br />
                + MXF: Package name<br />
                + AVC: Store method of interlaced content (Interleaved Fields or Separated Fields)<br />
                + EBUCore: acquisition metadata (Proof of concept, for feedback only)<br />
                x Matroska: frame rate detection algorithm revisited, less wrong numbers are expected<br />
                x SDP/Teletext: some pages were sometimes (when present in 2 different SDP lines) displayed several times<br />
                x MPEG-4/MOV: some hint tracks were not displayed]]></description>
